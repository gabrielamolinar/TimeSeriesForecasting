# Time Series Forecasting
Here you will find different forecasting models for time series:
- Persistent model (still TBD): The forecasted values are equal to the previous ones. 
- Multilinear Regression model: based on the Matlab tutorial [Time Series Regression VII: Forecasting](https://de.mathworks.com/help/econ/examples/time-series-regression-vii-forecasting.html), programmed in Python.
- Autoregressive model (still TBD): Based on Jason Brownlee's article ['Autoregression Models for Time Series Forecasting With Python'](https://machinelearningmastery.com/autoregression-models-time-series-forecasting-python/). 
- LSTM model: Based on Jason Brownlee's article ['Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with LSTMs in Keras'](https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/#comment-435368).

To run these programs use Jupyter Notebook. 

Hint: Use a conda environment to install all requirements for these projects and not directly in your machine.
